# Luke's Law

Theorem:

>**For every 2 x 2 taxonomy in computer science, one of the categories is useless.**

Examples:

* Cache tagging and indexing: physically-indexed, virtually-tagged is useless.
* Flynn's Taxonomy: multiple-instruction, single-data is useless.
* Pipeline data hazards: read-after-read is useless.
